# frictionless_sysml_usage

This project shows an example of importing Excel data representing a part
hierarchy for a project and repackaging it into the frictionless data format
for easier processing. The current setup has a Jupyter notebook for an 
example process and the resultant data archive in the 'dist' directory.
